# Project 5: Recovery

This project is due: **Friday, 5/1/2020, 11:59 PM**.

## Overview

In this project, you will implement write-ahead logging.

## Prerequisites

You should watch the Recovery lectures before working on this project.

## Getting Started

The test cases for this project are all located in
`src/test/java/edu/berkeley/cs186/database/recovery/TestRecoveryManager.java`.
To build and test your code in the container, run the following inside
`/cs186/sp20-moocbase`:

```bash
mvn clean test -D proj=5
```

There should be 8 failures, 4 errors, and 23 tests run.

## Understanding the Skeleton Code

This project will be centered around `ARIESRecoveryManager.java`, which
implements the `RecoveryManager` interface. `ARIESRecoveryManager.java` is
responsible for pretty much everything related to recovery.

Recall that there are two distinct modes of operation: _forward processing_
which is where we perform logging and maintain some metadata such as the dirty
page table and transaction table during normal operation of the database, and
_restart recovery_ (a.k.a. crash recovery), which is the processes taken when the
database starts up again.

Both forward processing and restart recovery are handled by
`ARIESRecoveryManager`. During normal operation, the rest of the database calls
various methods of the recovery manager to indicate that certain operations
(e.g. a page write or flush) have occurred. During a restart, the `restart`
method is called, which should bring the database back to its current state.

Detailed descriptions of when each of the methods of the recovery manager are
called are available in `RecoveryManager.java` as well as the appropriate
sections of this README. You should read through `RecoveryManager.java`, as well
as `ARIESRecoveryManager.java` before starting.

An entry in the transaction table is represented by the `TransactionTableEntry`
class; you should read through `TransactionTableEntry.java` as well.

The recovery manager also uses other interfaces such as LogManager and LogRecord.
Be sure to read through and understand those interfaces, summaries of which are
included further down in this readme and also within the codebase.

### Functional objects in Java

The project uses functional objects/interfaces in several places, which you may
not be familiar with.

If you are not familiar with these in Java, you should look through [the
official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html)
a bit - they are essentially how you pass around functions and lambdas in Java, and
the list of interfaces in the above link are simply the types of various types
of functions.

Each interface has a method to call the passed in function (for example, [the
`Consumer` interface has the `accept`
method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html#accept-T-)).

### `LogRecord` and `LogManager`

To help with implementing the recovery manager, the skeleton code provides code
for all the different log records, and for the log manager, which handles
writing and reading from the log.

You should read through both `LogRecord.java` and `LogManager.java` to get a sense of
the public methods available to you through `LogManager` and `LogRecord` as you implement `ARIESRecoveryManager`. Keep in mind that `LogManager.java` and `LogRecord.java` are java
interface and abstract class, respectively. There are additional comments in the
subclasses such as `LogManagerImpl.java`, `UpdatePageLogRecord.java`, etc. that you may
find helpful when writing or debugging your code.

### Disk Space Manager

You will not need to directly use the disk space manager in this project (the
various `LogRecord` subclasses will use it for you as needed), but it does help
to understand how our disk space manager organizes data at a high level.

The disk space manager is responsible for allocating pages, and our disk space
manager divides pages into _partitions_. Page 40000000001, for example, is the
1st page (0-indexed) in partition 4. Partitions are explicitly allocated and
freed (but can only be freed if there are no pages in them), and pages are
always allocated under a partition.

Partition 0 is reserved for storing the log, which is why in a couple of places,
you will see checks comparing the partition number against 0.

### Buffer Manager

Although most of the communication between the buffer manager and recovery
manager is in the form of the buffer manager calling various methods of the
recovery manager, there are a couple of places during recovery where you will
need to use the buffer manager.

You should read through both `memory/BufferManager.java` and the comments of
`memory/Page.java`.

A few important points/methods about the buffer manager:
- `BufferManager#fetchPage` will return a `Page` object corresponding to the
  passed in page number. *This page comes pinned*, so whenever you use this
  method, you must make sure that you unpin the returned `Page` object
  via the `Page#unpin` method. A common pattern you will find
  throughout the rest of the codebase is the following:

  ```java
  Page page = bufferManager.fetchPage(...);
  try {
      // code that uses page
  } finally {
      page.unpin();
  }
  ```

  This ensures that the page is properly unpinned, even if you put a return
  statement or throw an exception inside the `try` block.

  Note that very little can be done while the page is unpinned (pretty much all
  you can do is fetch the page number or pin the page with `Page#pin`), so you
  will need to make sure that you only unpin when you are done using the page.

  The last parameter of `fetchPage` is a boolean called `logPage`. This should
  be `true` for pages of the log itself, and `false` for all other pages.

- `BufferManager#iterPageNums` lets you perform an action on the page numbers of
  each page loaded in a frame in the buffer manager; it is basically equivalent
  to the following (where `process` is the function object passed in to
  `iterPageNums`):

  ```java
  for (buffer frame in buffer manager) {
      long pageNum = frame.pageNum;
      boolean dirty = frame.dirty;
      process(pageNum, dirty);
  }
  ```

## Forward Processing

![happy database icon](images/proj5-db-happy.png)

When the database is undergoing normal operation - where transactions are
running normally, reading and writing data - the job of the recovery manager is
to maintain the log, by adding log records and ensuring that the log is properly
flushed when necessary, so that we can recover from a crash at any time.

### Initialization

At the time the database is first created, before any transactions run, the
recovery manager needs to first set the log up, and this is done in the
`initialize` method in `ARIESRecoveryManager.java`.

We store the _master record_ as the very first log record in the log, at LSN
0 (recall that the master record stores the LSN of the begin checkpoint record
of the most recent successful checkpoint).

To simplify things when implementing the analysis phase of restart recovery, we
also immediately perform a checkpoint, writing a begin and end checkpoint record
in succession, and updating the master record.

This method has been implemented for you.

### Transaction Status

Part of the recovery manager's job during forward processing is to maintain the
status of running transactions, and log changes in transaction status. The
recovery manager is notified of changes in transaction status through four
methods:

- `startTransaction` is called when a transaction is started (in the `RUNNING`
  state), before it can do anything. This is provided for you.
- `commit` is called when a transaction attempts to move into the `COMMITTING`
  state.
- `abort` is called when a transaction attempts to move into the `ABORTING`
  state.
- `end` is called when a transaction attempts to move into the `COMPLETE` state.

If the transaction ends in an abort, all changes must be rolled back\* before an
EndTransaction record is written, and this should happen when `end` is called.

In the three methods (`commit`, `abort`, `end`) that you need to implement, you
will need to keep the transaction table up-to-date, set the status of the
transaction accordingly, and write the appropriate log record to the log.

Recall from lecture that while committing, the commit record needs to be flushed to
disk before the commit call returns - the same must happen here as well.

\* Tips on undoing changes: only records that are undoable (`LogRecord#isUndoable`)
should be undone, and the CLR of an undoable record can be obtained via the
`LogRecord#undo` method. Note that this method _does not_ actually perform the
undo -- you will need to call `redo` on the returned CLR.

### Page Flush

The recovery manager has two different methods that are called at different
times when a page is flushed:

- `pageFlushHook` is called by the buffer manager *before* a dirty page is
  flushed to disk and evicted from the buffer cache. This method is called only
  when a page is *flushed* not evicted, and only on pages that are _not_ part of
  the log (this second point is important, because it helps avoid infinite mutual
  recursion between the recovery manager and buffer manager).
- `diskIOHook` is called by the disk space manager *after* a dirty page has been
  successfully flushed to disk.

Recall from lecture that before a page is flushed, it must satisfy
`pageLSN <= flushedLSN`. These two methods are provided to you.

### Logging

The recovery has several methods that are called when certain events happen:

- `logPageWrite` is called by the buffer manager whenever someone tries to write
  to part of a page that is not part of the log. The buffer manager guarantees
  that a single update covers at most `BufferManager.EFFECTIVE_PAGE_SIZE` bytes.

  We require that all log records are at most `DiskSpaceManager.PAGE_SIZE` bytes
  when serialized on disk. A page update can hold up to
  `BufferManager.EFFECTIVE_PAGE_SIZE` bytes of changes, but an update over a `x`
  byte region requires `2x` bytes in changes (before and after). Therefore,
  whenever a page update comes in over a region larger than
  `BufferManager.EFFECTIVE_PAGE_SIZE / 2` bytes, we split it up into two
  records:
  - an undo-only update record, then
  - a redo-only update record.

  (note: order is important, in case we crash after writing only one of these).

  If a page update is over a smaller region, we just emit a single update record
  with both redo and undo information.

- `logAllocPart`, `logFreePart`, `logAllocPage`, `logFreePage`: these are called
  by the disk space manager whenever someone tries to create or delete a partition
  or page, and should emit the appropriate log record. This is implemented for you.

All of these methods should keep the tables maintained by the recovery manager
up-to-date (the dirty page table and transaction table).

### Savepoints

Recall from lecture that SQL has
[savepoints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-savepoint.html) to allow
for _partial rollback_: `SAVEPOINT pomelo` creates a savepoint named `pomelo`
for the current running transaction, allowing a user to rollback all changes made
after the savepoint by using `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pomelo`. The savepoint can
be deleted with `RELEASE SAVEPOINT pomelo`.

Write-ahead logging lets us implement savepoints. The recovery manager has three
methods related to savepoints, which correspond to the three SQL statements
for savepoints, and follow the semantics of the corresponding SQL statements:

- `savepoint` creates a savepoint for the current transaction with the specified
  name. As with the `SAVEPOINT` statement in SQL, the name of the savepoint is
  scoped to the transaction: two different transactions may have their own
  savepoint called `pomelo`.

- `releaseSavepoint` deletes a specific savepoint for the current transaction;
  it behaves the same as the `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` statement in SQL.

- `rollbackToSavepoint` rolls the transaction back to the specified savepoint.
  All changes done after the savepoint should be undone, similarly to an
  aborting transaction, except the status of the transaction does not change;
  it behaves the same way as the `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` statement in SQL.

  See [Transaction Status](#transaction-status) for more details on undoing
  changes.

The skeleton code has provided most of the implementation of savepoints for you -
all that is left is to implement the logic for undoing changes in
`rollbackToSavepoint`. This is extremely similar to the undo logic in `end()`,
so we suggest making a helper method to reuse a lot of the logic from there.

### Checkpoints

Recall from lecture that in ARIES, we periodically perform _fuzzy checkpoints_
which occur even while other transactions run, to minimize recovery time after
a crash, without bringing the database to a halt during forward processing.

The approach is outlined below. Note that part of the implementation is already
provided to you; you are responsible for writing the end checkpoint records
that are not covered by the given code.

First, a begin checkpoint record is added to the log.

Then, we write end checkpoint records, accounting for the fact that we may
have to break up end checkpoint records due to too many DPT/Xact table entries.
This is similar to how we sometimes had to break apart UpdatePage records into
two in order to fit the change on one page; we may also need to write multiple
end checkpoint records, if there too many DPT/transaction table entries.

An end checkpoint record should be written even if all tables are empty, and
multiple end checkpoint records should only be written if necessary.

This is done as follows:

- iterate through the dirtyPageTable and copy the entries. If at any point, copying the
  current record would cause the end checkpoint record to be too large, an end
  checkpoint record with the copied DPT entries should be appended to the log.
- iterate through the transaction table, and copy the status/lastLSN, outputting
  end checkpoint records only as needed.
- iterate through the transaction table, and copy the touched pages, outputting
  end checkpoint records only as needed. Transactions without any touched pages
  should not appear here at all.
- output one final end checkpoint.

Finally, we must rewrite the master record with the LSN of the begin checkpoint
record of the new successful checkpoint.

As an example, we might output the following end checkpoint records in the
following order:
- EndCheckpoint with 200 DPT entries and 52 transaction table entries
- EndCheckpoint with 240 transaction table entries
- EndCheckpoint with 1 transaction table entry and 507 page numbers dirtied by
  transaction #5.
- EndCheckpoint with 10 page numbers dirtied by transaction #5, and 30 page
  numbers dirtied by transaction #77.

You may find the `EndCheckpoint.fitsInOneRecord` static method useful for this;
it takes in four parameters:
- the number of dirty page table entries stored in the record,
- the number of transaction number/status/lastLSN entries stored in the record,
- the number of transactions represented in the touchedPages map in the record,
  and
- the number of page numbers in the touchedPages map in the record,
and returns whether the resulting record would fit in one page.

For example, for the record:

```
EndCheckpoint{dpt={1 => 30000, 2 => 33000, 3 => 34000},
              txnTable={1 => (RUNNING, 33000), 2 => (RUNNING, 34000)},
              touchedPages={1 => {1, 4}, 2 => {3, 4, 5, 6}}
             }
```

the corresponding call is:

```java
EndCheckpoint.fitsInOneRecord(3,     /* dpt entries */
                              2,     /* txnTable entries */
                              2,     /* # of txns in touchedPages */
                              2 + 4) /* # of page numbers in touched pages */
```

## Restart Recovery

![database icon going off the cliff into flames](images/proj5-db-off-the-cliff.png)

When the database starts up again, it enters restart recovery. Recall from
lecture that this involves three phases: analysis, redo, and undo.

The `RecoveryManager` interface exposes a single method for restart recovery:
the `restart` method, which is called when the database starts up.

In order to test each phase in isolation, the skeleton has three package-private
helper methods for restart recovery which you will need to implement:
`restartAnalysis`, `restartRedo`, and `restartUndo`, which perform the analysis,
redo, and undo phases respectively.

In addition to the three phases of recovery, the `restart` method should also do
two more things:
- between the redo and undo phases, any page in the dirty page table that isn't
  actually dirty (has changes in-memory that have not been flushed) should be
  removed from the dirty page table. These pages may be present in the DPT as
  a result of the analysis phase, if we are uncertain about whether a change has
  been flushed to disk successfully or not.
- after the undo phase, recovery has finished. To avoid having to abort all the
  transactions again should we crash, we take a checkpoint.

Finally, we allow for new transactions to start running once the redo phase has
completed. In order to do this, `restart` should return a `Runnable` that
performs the undo phase and checkpoint, instead of performing those actions
immediately. The `Database` object runs the `Runnable` object in the background
after `restart` returns.

### Analysis

This section concerns just the `restartAnalysis` method, which performs the
analysis pass of restart recovery.

#### Master Record

To begin analysis, the master record needs to be fetched, in order to find the
LSN of the checkpoint to start at (recall that in `initialize`, a checkpoint was
written near the start of the log, so there is always a checkpoint to start at).

#### Scanning the Log

The goal of analysis is to reconstruct the dirty page table and transaction
table from the log.

The many types of log records encounted while scanning fall into three
categories: log records for operations that a transaction does, checkpoint records,
and log records for transaction status changes (commit/abort/end). (There is
also the master record, but it should never come up while scanning the log).

##### Log Records for Transaction Operations

These are the records that involve a transaction, and therefore, we need to
update the transaction table whenever we encounter one of these records.

- If the transaction is not in the transaction table, it should be added to the
  table (the `newTransaction` function object can be used to create
  a `Transaction` object).
- The lastLSN of the transaction should be updated.
- If the log record is about a page (as opposed to the partition-related log
  records), the page needs to be added to the touchedPages set in the
  transaction table entry and the transaction needs to request an X lock on it.

Of the page-related log records,

- UpdatePage/UndoUpdatePage both may dirty a page in memory, without flushing
  changes to disk.
- AllocPage/FreePage/UndoAllocPage/UndoFreePage all make their changes visible
  on disk immediately, and can be seen as flushing all changes at the time
  (including their own) to disk.

The dirty page table needs to be updated accordingly when one of these page-related
log records are encountered.

##### Log Records for Transaction Status Changes

These three types of log records
(CommitTransaction/AbortTransaction/EndTransaction) all change the status of
a transaction.

When one of these records are encountered, the transaction table should be
updated as described in the previous section. The status of the transaction
should also be set to one of `COMMITTING`, `RECOVERY_ABORTING`, or `COMPLETE`.

If the record is an EndTransaction record, the transaction should also be
cleaned up before setting the status, and it should also be removed from the
transaction table entirely.

##### Checkpoint Records

When a BeginCheckpoint record is encountered, the
transaction counter needs to be updated (`updateTransactionCounter`).

When an EndCheckpoint record is encountered, the tables stored in the record
should be combined with the tables currently in memory:

- The recLSN of a page in the checkpoint should always be used, even if we have
  an record in the dirty page table already, since the checkpoint is always more
  accurate than anything we can infer from just the log.
- The lastLSN of a transaction in the checkpoint should only be used if it is
  not smaller than the lastLSN of the transaction in the transaction memory (if
  present).
- All pages in the touchedPages table for a transaction should be added to the
  touchedPages set for the transaction in memory, if the transaction has not
  finished yet, and an X lock requested for each page.

#### Ending Transactions

The transaction table at this point should have transactions that are in one of
the following states: `RUNNING`, `COMMITTING`, or `RECOVERY_ABORTING`.

All transactions in the `COMMITTING` state should be ended (`cleanup()`, state set
to `COMPLETE`, end transaction record written, and removed from the transaction
table).

All transactions in the `RUNNING` state should be moved into the
`RECOVERY_ABORTING` state, and an abort transaction record should be written.

Nothing needs to be done for transactions in the `RECOVERY_ABORTING` state.

### Redo

This section concerns just the `restartRedo` method, which performs the
redo pass of restart recovery.

Recall from lecture that the redo phase begins at the lowest recLSN in the dirty
page table. Scanning from that point on, we redo a record if all of the
following apply:

- it is a redoable record, and
- either it is a partition-related record, or it is a page-related record where
  - the page is in the DPT, and
  - the LSN is not less than the recLSN of the page, and
  - the pageLSN on the page itself is strictly less than the LSN of the record.

### Undo

This section concerns just the `restartUndo` method, which performs the
undo pass of restart recovery.

Recall from lecture that during the undo phase, we do not abort and undo the
transactions one by one, due to a large number of random I/Os incurred as
a result. Instead, we repeatedly undo the log record (that needs to be undone)
with the highest LSN until we are done, making only one pass through the log.

The undo phase begins with the set of lastLSN of each of the aborting transactions (in
the `RECOVERY_ABORTING` state).

We repeatedly fetch the log record of the largest of these LSNs and:
- if the record is undoable, we undo it\* and write the CLR out, updating the DPT
  as necessary;
- replace the LSN in the set with the undoNextLSN of the record if it has one,
  and the prevLSN otherwise;
- end the transaction if the LSN from the previous step is 0, removing it from
  the set and the transaction table.

\* The `undo` method of `LogRecord` does not actually undo changes - it instead
returns the compensation log record and a boolean flag indicating whether the
log must be flushed after performing the undo. To actually undo changes, you will
need to call `redo` on the returned CLR.

## Tying it all up

There is one TODO(proj5) comment in `TransactionImpl#startCommit` in `Database.java`.
This is just removing a line of code and replacing it with the commented code, 
and sets up the database to use recovery.

(This part won't actually be submitted and won't affect the Project 5 tests,
so don't worry about any errors from past project in Database.java)

## Testing

We strongly encourage writing more tests than given, as the given tests for
this project are not comprehensive tests:
it is possible to write incorrect code that passes them all (but not get full score).

You may use the given test cases as starting points to create your own tests.

Note that there are some helper methods defined for testing at the bottom of the
test file, which may be helpful (or crucial) for writing tests. We suggest also
looking at the `TestRecoveryManager.java` file for an example of how to write
tests with these helper methods.

## Submitting the Assignment

See [the main readme](README.md#submitting-assignments) for submission instructions.
The assignment  number for this project is proj5.

**Each partner MUST submit their own project!**

Slip minutes will be deducted individually. For example: You submit on time, but your partner submits a day late. Your partner will have to use a day's worth of slip minutes or will receive a late penalty on the project (but you will not).

You may **not** modify the signature of any methods or classes that we provide to you, but you're free to
add helper methods.

You should make sure that all code you modify belongs to files with proj5 todo comments in them (e.g. don't add helper methods to DataBox). A full list of files that you may modify follows:

- recovery/ARIESRecoveryManager.java
- recovery/TestARIESStudent.java (in the test directory)

Make sure that your code does *not* use any static (non-final) variables - this may cause odd behavior when
running with maven vs. in your IDE (tests run through the IDE often run with a new instance
of Java for each test, so the static variables get reset, but multiple tests per Java instance
may be run when using maven, where static variables *do not* get reset).

## Important differences from ARIES as presented in lecture

There are a few important differences between ARIES as presented in the lecture,
and the implementation of the recovery manager that you need to do in this
project, which are mostly implementation details. **On exams, you should use
the simplified version of ARIES as described in lecture whenever this project and
lecture diverge.**

### Forward Processing

|   | Project                                                               | Lecture                             |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Page Updates may be two records (Undo & Redo)                         | Page Updates are always one record  |
| 2 | Log page/partition allocations/frees                                  | No such logging                     |
| 3 | Begin Checkpoint has transaction number                               | Begin Checkpoint has no information |
| 4 | End Checkpoint may have many records                                  | End Checkpoint is one record        |
| 5 | End Checkpoint and Transaction table have info about "touched" pages  | No such information is stored       |

- Page updates may be split up into two different records: an undo-only record,
  followed by a redo-only record, whereas in lecture, a single update
  corresponds to a single record that is both redoable and undoable.

  **Explanation:** In this implementation, we need a single log record to fit on
  a page. For very large updates (more than half of the page), it is impossible
  to fit both undo information and redo information in under a page (we need
  around 2x the amount of data updated when logging an update). For this reason,
  we choose to break up the update into two. The undo-only record must come
  first, so that we can revert the change should we crash before the redo-only
  record makes it to disk.

- We log page/partition allocations/frees.

  **Explanation:** This is just a quirk of how our disk space manager works, to
  ensure that it can be brought back to a consistent state after a crash.

- We keep the transaction number in the begin checkpoint record, whereas in
  lecture, the begin checkpoint has no information.

  **Explanation:** This is simply to ensure that after restart recovery with
  a checkpoint, we do not reuse transaction numbers from before the restart.

- A checkpoint may have many end\_checkpoint records, whereas in lecture, only
  a single end\_checkpoint record is used.

  **Explanation:** This is once more due to the fact that we need a single log
  record to fit in a page: we may have so many transactions/dirty pages that we
  cannot fit it all in one page.

- The end\_checkpoint record(s) and transaction table also contains information
  about all the pages that the transaction has "touched", whereas in lecture,
  this information is not maintained at all.

  **Explanation:** In order to re-acquire locks efficiently during restart
  recovery, we keep this information and write it in checkpoints - otherwise,
  the presence of a single transaction that has been running since the beginning
  of time up to the crash requires us to scan from the start of the log to
  determine what pages it needs to lock, even if we have a recent checkpoint.

### Restart Recovery

|   | Project                                                                                   | Lecture                                                    |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Clean up dirty page table after redoing changes                                           | Step does not exist                                        |
| 2 | Checkpoint after undo                                                                     | Step does not exist                                        |
| 3 | Process checkpoints upon reaching end\_checkpoint record (single pass)                    | Load checkpoints before starting analysis (2 passes)       |
| 4 | Process page/partition allocation/free records (may remove entries from dirty page table) | These entries do not exist                                 |

- We clean out the dirty page table of all pages that are not dirty in the
  buffer manager, after redoing all changes, whereas in lecture, this step is
  omitted.

  **Explanation:** We would like the dirty page table to reflect pages that are
  actually dirty (because the only time they get removed is when the page is
  flushed, which may not ever happen if the already-flushed page is never
  modified again). We omit this step in lecture and exams out of simplicity.

- We checkpoint after undo, whereas in lecture, this step is omitted.

  **Explanation:** This is a fairly unimportant step (it is not necessary for
  correctness - we have completely recovered after undo), but it is useful for
  performance reasons and a natural point to perform a checkpoint, and avoid
  a lot of work the next time we crash.

- We do a single pass through the records, processing checkpoints upon reaching the end-checkpoint record, whereas in lecture we first create the checkpoint's table and then scan through the log

  **Explanation:** The two approaches are equivalent - they will result in the
  exact same tables after analysis, but it is both simpler and more efficient to
  process the end\_checkpoint records and add their information to the tables in
  memory as we reach them, especially since we have multiple end\_checkpoint
  records.

- We process page/partition allocation/free records, and in some cases, remove
  the page from the dirty page table while doing so.

  **Explanation:** See explanation about these records under forward processing.
  In some cases (free page/undo alloc page), we remove a page from the dirty
  page table, and in others (alloc page/undo free page), we do not add the page
  to the dirty page table. This is because these operations all update on-disk
  data immediately.

## Supplemental Reading

If you enjoyed the material in this project and the previous project
(Locking), we recommend reading through the ARIES paper ([link
here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/cs345/rl/aries.pdf))!

Nothing in the ARIES paper is in-scope for the class (and where what we teach in
class conflicts with the paper, material from this class takes precedence), but
the paper (albeit long) is well-written and talks more about the context behind
design decisions for both multigranularity locking and ARIES, as well as more
details that come up in implementations. You should have enough background at
this point in the course to read and understand it, so we recommend reading
through it at your own pace if this portion of the course caught your interest.

## Grading

- 50% of your grade will be made up of tests released to you (the tests that we provided in
  `database.recovery.TestRecoveryManager.java`).
- 50% of your grade will be made up of hidden, unreleased tests that we will run on your submission
  after the deadline.
